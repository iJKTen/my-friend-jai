This is my second attempt at running a blog. This time, I promise, again, to update this blog regularly.

I ended up choosing Gatsby because I found a <a href="//github.com/abhaynikam/gatsby-nice-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">theme</a> I liked.

## My Promise to you

I don't have a plan yet but few things you will never see on this blog are articles like, top 10 things you need to know, because let's be honest, those are catchy recycled titles that do not provide any value.

I do not promise to only talk about tech. So if you are here for tech then you might be disappointed.

I do not run or plan to run any kind of analytics or track you with 3rd party cookies.

That's it for now but do follow me on <a href="//twitter.com/MyFriendJai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitter</a> and view this blog in dark mode!

Born in the U.S. but raised in the U.K., soulful R&B vocalist Celeste Waite channels influences such as Aretha Franklin and Billie Holiday to craft languid, jazzy numbers that are elevated by her powerful voice and poetic lyrics.

I promise, I don't find artists because they are from U.K or raised in the U.K but artists from U.K are making music that I like.

Celeste fell in love with Aretha Franklin, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, the Supremes, Destiny's Child, and Solange. Her father passed away when she was 16 and, years later when she happened upon his old vinyl collection, she immersed herself in the wealth. Her personal poetry evolved into song and, by the time she was enrolled in college, she made the decision to pursue music.

My love for instrumental and shill music aside, I do like artists with their own personal poetry.

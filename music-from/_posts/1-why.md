I found this music blog by [Paul Irish](//twitter.com/paul_irish) called [and others called aurgasm](//aurgasm.us) where I found some of the artists that I liked. This is an attempt to replicate that blog.

If you like electronic, downtempo, or chill music then may be you and I have similar taste in music and maybe you will like some of the songs I found.

I still have few things to figure out with this theme and next.js, like, posts not sorting in descending order and the general fonts and colors. I recommend you view this blog in dark mode.

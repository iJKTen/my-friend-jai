Indie-folk duo JOHNNYSWIM formed after Amanda Sudano—who honed her musical skills touring with her mom, Donna Summer—began writing songs with her future husband, Abner Ramirez.

In 2020, they launched a weekly creative exercise called Songs With Strangers, in which they spend one day creating a song from scratch with a randomly selected fan via social media.

There is a [bar/restaurant](https://www.elsegundorestaurants.com/norwalk/) I like to go and there I met bar tender called Abner. I didn't realize back then but the husband of Amanda Sudano, is also called Abner.

Click [here](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKMtVeK9RzU) to listen to the song.

Anaïs Oluwatoyin Estelle Marinho known professionally as [Arlo Parks](//www.arloparksofficial.com/) is UK singer-songwriter who has captivated listeners around the world with her soft, poetic mix of indie, soul, and pop.

Born in West London, Parks learned to speak French before English. As a child, she wrote short fantasy stories, journaled, and got into watching spoken-word performances on YouTube.

Parks has been open about her passion for literature in previous interviews and has cited Ezra Pound and Sylvia Plath as poets she admires.

The title "George" references the salacious 19th century poet and politician Lord George Byron and uses his character to construct an inventive narrative in the lyrics. "It was mainly about his heartbreaker tendencies and his kind of narcissism", Parks explains. "When I read his poems, he just seems very sorry for himself and not aware of other people he's hurt. So, I kind of imagined someone like that walking into a room and seeing all the people that they've hurt. It sounds so cheesy, but like [he's] leaving a trail of broken hearts. It's like I know he's been here and leaving these little broken people everywhere and you kind of know that that’s the damage [he's] caused. So, yeah, I guess it’s his brutal narcissism."
